first start the node server from webrtc-video-call path server.js
then start react app from client and share the local address of react app showed in terminal with other devices connected
to wifi
and to see devices available on wifi enable insecure wifi origin from chrome labs and also paste the local address of react app there
do the same procedure of chrome labs with any device you want to communicate with 
and most importantly turn windows defender firewall off

and ik i've added node modules to github which is a wrong practice, but it was done intentionally
